### Twelfth Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders
After 6 years, the Pacific Island Conference of Leaders met in person in Honolulu, Hawai'i. Leaders from 16 Pacific Island Nations were in attendance along with representatives from the Council of Regional Organisations in the Pacific for a closed high-level meeting focused on regional priorities and concerns. 

Throughout summer, I had undergone IT training with PIDP that enabled me to:
* set up the digital equipment, configure the streaming platforms and checking that the hardware and software components were working as expected.
* testing of the live stream and resolving issues
* implement the backup cloud for the recording
* monitoring the stream to ensure good audio and video quality, manage the audience engagement tools and troubleshooting
* guided delegates on how to be comfortable with the technology used in the conference.

This technical side of livestreaming the event was a big project as we ventured into independently webcasting the conference instead of hiring a third party company to come and do it. While we still sought help from the contracted company that East West Center usually hires, throughout the conference there was little dependence between us.
