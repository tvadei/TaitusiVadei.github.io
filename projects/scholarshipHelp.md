summary: "Provided scholarship resources for Fijian students and mentorship"
---

During my holiday trip back home to Fiji last winter, I asked my high school teacher if I could do a talk on how I was able to obtain the United States South Pacific Scholarship under the East West Center. She gladly agreed and I presented to her year level class the application process of applying for the scholarship, and provided them with essay writing tips and how to prepare for the scholarship interview. I not only talked about the East West Center scholarship, but also talked about the differences in applying for other scholarships Fijian students are eligible for. I was able to walk them through application strategies for the Australian DFAT Scholarship, India ICCR scholarship, Japan MEXT scholarship, Chinese Government Scholarship and the Korean GSK-U scholarship as I had also applied for these scholarships. I regularly email my high school teachers any updates of scholarships and have communicated with junior students on how to prepare.
