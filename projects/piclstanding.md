### The 11th Pacific Island Conference of Leaders
Pacific Island Leaders of Nations and Territories that are catered to by the Pacific Islands Development Program met virtually on the 1st and 2nd of June to discuss critical regional priorities such as climate change, economic development, infrastructure development, education development, equity and socio-economic disparities. The Pacific Islands Program serves member nations and territories thorugh innovative capacity building at regional and community levels, interdialogue among regional leaders and partners, and policy-relevant research on priority issues. 

PIDP was due for a revamp of its role in regional organizations and one of the projects that we were part of was the review of its legislation, policies and procedures that goes all the way back to 1980s, when it was founded. We sifted through files and took note of legislation, policies and procedures that were developed in different timelines and how they related to specific areas of concern for the Pacific within that timeline. Therefore we had to do extensive research on these issues, determining if the issues are still of significant concern now or how recommendations made may have resolved it. 

It was at the standing committee in December post PICL conference where we had to present a report of our findings.
